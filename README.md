# temp-berry
Reading data from both sensor MLX90615 and HCSR04

## Notes
  If you get an error like this:

	
        [Error: , Remote I/O error] {
	  errno: 121,
  	code: '',
	  syscall: 'readWord'
	}

  then you should check the MLX temperature sensor is well connected,

Also inside the trials folder are files to check each sensor individually.
